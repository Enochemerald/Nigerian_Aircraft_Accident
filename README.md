# ✈️ Nigerian Aircraft Accident Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Nigerian aircraft accident data, focusing on trends in accidents and fatalities, accident severity, operator and aircraft involvement, and other key insights.

## 📈 Yearly Trends

### Accident Trends
- The frequency of aircraft accidents in Nigeria has shown fluctuations over the years.
- Notable peaks were observed in **2005**, **2006**, and **2012**, indicating particularly high-risk periods.

### Fatality Trends
- Fatalities have closely followed accident trends, with spikes aligning with the years of increased accident counts.
- A significant number of deaths occurred between **2005 and 2012**, marking a critical period for aviation safety concerns.

## 🧍‍♂️ Top Operators Involved in Accidents

### Top 5 by Number of Accidents:
1. **Nigerian Air Force - NAF** *(10 accidents)*
2. **Skypower Express Airways**
3. **Federal Nigerian Air Force**
4. **Wings Aviation**
5. **Dana Air**, **Chanchangi Airlines**, and **Associated Aviation** *(tie)*

These operators collectively account for the majority of the reported accidents in the data.

## 💥 Accident Severity & Impact

### Based on "Status":
- **w/o (Write-Off)**: 35 accidents → Aircraft destroyed.
- **sub (Substantial Damage)**: 13 accidents → Major structural damage.
- **min (Minor Damage)**: 2 accidents.
- **non (Non-accidental damage)**: 1 case.

This highlights a high proportion (over **60%**) of severe accidents leading to total aircraft loss.

## 💀 Fatality Distribution by Operator

|-----------------------------|------------|
| Nigerian Air Force - NAF    | **159**    |
| Dana Air                    | 108        |
| Bellview Airlines           | 117        |
| Sosoliso Airlines           | 96         |
| ADC Airlines                | 103        |
| Associated Aviation         | 11         |
| Sky Executive Airlines      | 18         |
| Others                      | 218        |

> 🟥 **Note:** The **NAF** and major domestic airlines accounted for the majority of fatalities.

## 🛩️ Aircraft Types & Fatalities

| Aircraft Type                          | Fatalities |
|----------------------------------------|------------|
| McDonnell Douglas DC-9-83 (MD-83)      | High       |
| Boeing 737 (various models)            | High       |
| Fokker F-27 Friendship 400M            | Moderate   |
| Lockheed C-130H Hercules               | High       |

| Others                                 | Varies     |

Certain commercial and military aircraft types were associated with higher fatality counts, with the **DC-9-83** and **Boeing 737** being the most affected.

## 📊 Summary Statistics

| Metric               | Value       |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Total Accidents      | **51**      |
| Total Fatalities     | **830**     |
| Total Aircraft Types | **43**      |
| Non-Fatalities       | **33**      |

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Most accidents** were catastrophic in nature (write-offs), indicating either severe mechanical failure, pilot error, or environmental conditions.
- **Military operators (NAF)** accounted for a large share of accidents and fatalities.
- **Commercial carriers** like Dana Air, Bellview Airlines, and Sosoliso also showed significant fatality counts.
- **Substantial seasonal variations** are observed, but more granular monthly data would be needed for deeper trend analysis.
